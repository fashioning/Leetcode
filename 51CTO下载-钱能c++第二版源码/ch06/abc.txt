In his latest job at a hospital, Sam has
access to the birth records. By switching
newborns' parents around, he can
'conveniently' fix the families up
properly after a few days, and hopefully get cash awards from both sides.
However, he needs to make sure that when
he switches the kids around, there's no
way that the blood types match up with
the new parents--they might not believe him otherwise.
