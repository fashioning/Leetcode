In recent years, 
high-speed and high-responsibility photodetectors operated at long-wavelength are required for high-bit-rate and 
long-haul optical communication systems. Traditional vertical p-i-n photodetectors have shown promising result. 
However, there is a limitation between quantum efficiency and bandwidth. As higher quantum efficiency needs a 
thicker absorption layer, the carrier transit time is extended which leads to a decreased bandwidth at the same time.
Furthermore, the photodiode RC time constant and parasitic capacitance from the periphery of the device has been 
a severe limitation to the speed of the detector response for the detector with 3dB bandwidth in the high frequency[l]. 
The design trade-off between quantum efficiency and bandwidth can be alleviated according to the use of drift-enhanced, 
dual-absorption structure for the long wavelength photodetectors. In the dual-absorption layer photodetector(PD) structure[2],[3]£¬
the photocurrents generated in both of the absorption regions are combined to increase the responsivity of the photodetector, 
while the transit time of the carriers remains the same as that of a single absorption photodetector since the carriers are collected separately
from each absorption region [4]. Meanwhile, this structure can achieve higher quantum efficiency because the absorption length increases.
In order to further improve its bandwidth, this paper proposes a mushroom-like dual-absorption photodetector.
According to decrease the diameter of absorption layer largely preserves the transit time limited bandwidth while easing RC limit, 
since the device capacitance is lowered by without affecting transit time apparently [5]. 
This paper will discuss response and capacitance characteristics of mushroom PD compared with conventional PD, 
and then find optimized structure proceed to analysis.
